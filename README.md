### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in progress of getting PhD in electronics (ITMO University), my dissertation is about:
      ðŸ’Š Endoscopic systems for postoperative monitoring of patients

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anyone, who wants to start some interesting project (from 2d platform game to new engineering solution for some math distribution)

ðŸ“± Easiest way to contact with me: @vptyp - telegram

ðŸ”‰ I also enjoy listening to Kendrick Lamar and ~~Drake~~ _(ain't no big three, it's just big me)_ during my work time to help me concentrate. Their music provides a great backdrop for my creative process and helps me stay focused.

 ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª In free time learning german, so will be happy to talk with native speakers :D
